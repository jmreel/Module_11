# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project:
Dana is a data journalist that has access to a JavaScript file that is filled to the brim with UFO sightings information. With the assistance of JavaScript’s visual functionality and to use JavaScript to display the data as a table Dana wants to filter through the dataset. Then the dataset will be posted online with an article, images, and the dataset in a table. In order to make the website more user friendly, users will be allowed to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. This way UFO enthusiast will be able to easily search through UFO sightings data. 

## Results:
With the assistance of the search criteria, it has never been easier to search for information about an UFO sighting from McMinnville, Oregon. Users will be able to use seven different search criteria’s: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Referencing the “app.js” allows JavaScript to use a filter function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, it will loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria.  

### UFO Search Criteria:

## Summary:

One drawback to using this search criteria is that the search criteria must be exact. The user must type the exact word or data in order to search through the dataset. If the user input 1/12/2010 as 01/12/2010 no information will be shown. The search criteria is also case sensitive. In order to improve the website, the code can be updated to allow for a wider search feature for dates and to also make the search criteria not case sensitive.
